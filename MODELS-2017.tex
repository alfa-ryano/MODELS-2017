% Some very useful LaTeX packages include:
% (uncomment the ones you want to load)


% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/ifpdf
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.






% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of the IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off
% such as if a citation ever needs to be enclosed in parenthesis.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 5.0 (2009-03-20) and later if using hyperref.sty.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/cite
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.






% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
  % \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../pdf/}{../jpeg/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png}
\else
  % or other class option (dvipsone, dvipdf, if not using dvips). graphicx
  % will default to the driver specified in the system graphics.cfg if no
  % driver is specified.
  % \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../eps/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.eps}
\fi
% graphicx was written by David Carlisle and Sebastian Rahtz. It is
% required if you want graphics, photos, etc. graphicx.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation
% can be obtained at: 
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/graphicx
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/epslatex
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). The IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.
%
% You can find documentation about the pdfTeX application at:
% http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex





% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics.
%
% Note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/amsmath





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as the IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithms
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithmicx




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/array


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.




% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=normalsize,labelfont=sf,textfont=sf]{subfig}
%\else
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%\fi
% subfig.sty, written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern replacement
% for subfigure.sty, the latter of which is no longer maintained and is
% incompatible with some LaTeX packages including fixltx2e. However,
% subfig.sty requires and automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty
% which will override IEEEtran.cls' handling of captions and this will result
% in non-IEEE style figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure
% and invoke subfig.sty's "caption=false" package option (available since
% subfig.sty version 1.3, 2005/06/28) as this is will preserve IEEEtran.cls
% handling of captions.
% Note that the Computer Society format requires a larger sans serif font
% than the serif footnote size font used in traditional IEEE formatting
% and thus the need to invoke different subfig.sty package options depending
% on whether compsoc mode has been enabled.
%
% The latest version and documentation of subfig.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/subfig




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure.
% Be aware that LaTeX2e kernels dated 2015 and later have fixltx2e.sty's
% corrections already built into the system in which case a warning will
% be issued if an attempt is made to load fixltx2e.sty as it is no longer
% needed.
% The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/fixltx2e


%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/stfloats
% Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as the IEEE does not allow
% \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the IEEE should note
% that the IEEE rarely uses double column equations and that authors should try
% to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the cuted.sty or midfloat.sty
% packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as the IEEE does not format its papers in
% such ways.
% Do not attempt to use stfloats with fixltx2e as they are incompatible.
% Instead, use Morten Hogholm'a dblfloatfix which combines the features
% of both fixltx2e and stfloats:
%
% \usepackage{dblfloatfix}
% The latest version can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/dblfloatfix




% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/url
% Basically, \url{my_url_here}.




% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.
% (Unless specifically asked to do so by the journal or conference you plan
% to submit to, of course. )

\section{Rationale}

\section{Design}

\subsection{Gameful Design}
\subsection{Pedagogical Design}
\subsection{Model-Driven Design}



\section{Demonstration}
In this section, an example is presented to demonstrate the use of the platform. The example is to show the of teaching the concept of substates in UML statechart modelling. In this demonstration, designers are assumed to have proficient knowledge and skills of statechart diagram while learners are assumed already understood the concept of states, transitions, start state, and final state. The following subsections are the order of the statechart from its definition to be fully used in a game play.
 
\subsection{Define Statechart Metamodel}
In order for the platform to support modelling in statechart diagram, designers have to define its metamodel first. The metamodel is written in Emfatic (\url{https://www.eclipse.org/emfatic}) and Eugenia-like annotations \cite{kolovos2015eugenia} are used to define its concrete syntax. For example, the definition of Start State derived from Node class is displayed in Fig. \ref{metamodel}. Other basic elements of statechart diagram, such as states, transitions, end states, etc., are also defined but not displayed in the figure.  

\begin{figure}[t!]
\centering
\begin{lstlisting}
abstract class Node extends Entity {
  ref Edge[*]#source outgoing;
  ref Edge[*]#target incoming;
}

@gmf.node(mxLabel="name", mxShape="startState", mxWhiteSpace="wrap", mxHtml="1", mxFillColor="#000000", mxWidth="30", mxHeight="30")
class Start extends Node {
}
\end{lstlisting} 
\caption{A definition of Start State derived from Node class using Emfatic and Eugenia-like annotations.}
\label{metamodel}
\end{figure}

The annotated metamodel then trasformed using Epsilon \cite{kolovos2010epsilon} and EMF (\url{http://www.eclipse.org/modeling/emf/}) to generate the Java codes of the metamodel, as the backbone codes for further model operations, and Javascript codes to display the statechart's elements as visual elements in a palette of an MxGraph-based graphical editor (\url{https://jgraph.github.io/mxgraph/}). 

\subsection{Create Statechart Model}
Using the MxGraph-based graphical editor (Fig. \ref{ide}), designers can now create statechart models. The editor has a pallete on the left side that contains elements of statechart's elements which they can drag and drop into a drawing area on the centre where they can arrange the elements to construct statechart models. The editor also has a property panel on the right side to modify the attributes and appearance of the models. Models that have been created can be saved and loaded again for further operations. The editor also can be used to create models as input/base models to be embedded in learning activities.        

\begin{figure}[t!]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{ide}
\caption{The MxGraph-based graphical editor to create statechart models.}
\label{ide}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Create Learning Pattern Model}
To teach and learn a concept, designers have to design a learning pattern that consists of ordered learning activities. In this example, a learning pattern to learn the concept of substates is created (Fig. \ref{eoml}). The case that is selected is an electrical fan that has two main states, Idle and Blowing. Learners will be asked to modify the Blowing state so it becomes composite state that has several substates that represent different speed of blowing. The learning pattern has three activities, namely One-Speed Fan, Two-Speed Fan, and Tree-Speed Fan. The activities are arranged \textit{per se} to accommodate Flow state \cite{csikszentmihalyi2014toward} so learners can start learning from the easiest activity to the hardest one. The activities are explained in more detail  in the next following subsections.
  
\begin{figure}[t!]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{eoml}
\caption{A learning activity pattern for learning the concept of Substates in state-machine modelling.}
\label{eoml}
\end{figure}

Each activity has lesson and instruction properties. Lesson contains explanation about the concepts that are being taught and instruction contains commands or questions that learners need to execute or answer. In the process of satisfying the instruction in each activity, one or more objectives have to be met by learners in order to move to next activity. Also, each activity can consume existing models (Model A, B, and C in Fig. \ref{eoml}) as its base models so learners do not have to create a model from scratch and produce model (Model B in Fig. \ref{eoml}) to be used in its next activity. Each of the models also has a description property to describe itself which is very useful for learners to understand about the model. An example of the lesson, model description, and instruction properties of the One-Speed Fan activity (Fig. \ref{eoml}) is displayed in Fig. \ref{example-01a}.    

\begin{figure}[t!]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{example-01a}
\caption{Lesson, model description, and instruction.}
\label{example-01a}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{One-Speed Fan Activity}
In this activity (Fig. \ref{example-01}), learners are introduced to one substate only.The activity start with a base model and learners are required to modify the base model (Fig. \ref{example-01b}) to meet the target model (Fig. \ref{example-01c}). The base model corresponds to Model A in Fig. \ref{eoml}, which refers to an existing model that already created previously and will be loaded once the activity is executed so leaners do not need to create the model from the start. 

The example case in this activity is a fan that has three buttons, a Power Button to turn on/off, a Button 1 to start blowing, and a Button 0 to stop blowing. So far it has only one speed, Speed 1, but is planned to have more than one speed. Learners are asked to modify the Blowing state in Fig. \ref{example-01b} into a composite state through moving the Speed 1 state into the Blowing state compartment as well as to connect the Button 1 Pressed transition from the Idle state to the Speed 1 state. 

\begin{figure}[t!]
    \centering
    \subfloat[Base model]{\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{example-01b}	
    \label{example-01b}}
    \\
    \subfloat[Target model]{\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{example-01c}
    \label{example-01c}}
	\caption{The One-Speed Fan example.}
    \label{example-01}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Two-Speed Fan Activity}
The Two-Speed Fan activity (Fig. \ref{example-02}) consumes the model that has been produced in the first activity (Model B in Fig. \ref{eoml}). Therefore, any model produced in the previous activity will become the base model for modelling in this activity. Inline to the Flow concept \cite{csikszentmihalyi2014toward}, this second activity has to be more challenging. Therefore, the activity (Fig. \ref{example-02}) challenge learners with one additional state and three new transitions. Now the case has changed. The fan has an additional button, Button 2, to support 2-speed blowing. When Button 1 is pressed, the fan blows in speed 1. When Button 2 is pressed, the fan blows in speed 2. Thus, Learners are required modify the Blowing state into a composite state so it has two speed states. The fan can move from the Idle state to the Speed 1 state, from the Idle state to the Speed 2 state, and from the Speed 1 state to the Speed 2 state or \textit{vice versa}.

\begin{figure}[t!]
    \centering
    \subfloat[Base model]{\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{example-02b}	
    \label{example-02b}}
    \\
    \subfloat[Target model]{\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{example-02c}
    \label{example-02c}}
	\caption{The Two-Speed Fan example.}
    \label{example-02}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Three-Speed Fan Activity}
The Three-Speed Fan activity (Fig. \ref{example-03}) should be more difficult than the second activity. The fan now supports 3 speeds of blowing, but it has been modified so it cannot go directly to Speed 2 and Speed 3 without firstly go the state with lower speed. In other words, transition from Idle can only go to Speed 1 for the fan to start blowing--Speed 2 and Speed 3 will not be working if transition comes from Idle state. Thus, starting from the model C as the base model as shown in Fig. \ref{eoml}, learners are required to modify the Blowing state into a composite state so it has 3 speeds of blowing and only allow transition from Idle to Speed 1 and from a speed that is lower from the intended one in order to blow.

\begin{figure}[t!]
    \centering
    \subfloat[Base model]{\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{example-03b}	
    \label{example-03b}}
    \\
    \subfloat[Target model]{\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{example-03c}
    \label{example-03c}}
	\caption{The Three-Speed Fan example.}
    \label{example-03}
\end{figure}


\subsection{Generate Game}
After finishing constructing the learning pattern (Fig. \ref{eoml}), designers can now generate a path of levels (or stages) that is usually found in many games. Each generated level corresponds to an activity defined in the learning pattern. The generation also produces an EVL file for each level to be used for its validation whether the level has been completed or not. To complete a level, all of its objectives have to be met.   


Learners can choose the learning pattern if they want to learn substate concept in statechart modelling.    

\subsection{Play Game}

\section{Future Works}

% An example of a floating figure using the graphicx package.
% Note that \label must occur AFTER (or within) \caption.
% For figures, \caption should occur after the \includegraphics.
% Note that IEEEtran v1.7 and later has special internal code that
% is designed to preserve the operation of \label within \caption
% even when the captionsoff option is in effect. However, because
% of issues like this, it may be the safest practice to put all your
% \label just after \caption rather than within \caption{}.
%
% Reminder: the "draftcls" or "draftclsnofoot", not "draft", class
% option should be used if it is desired that the figures are to be
% displayed while in draft mode.
%
%\begin{figure}[!t]

% and a .pdf suffix will be assumed for pdflatex; or what has been declared
% via \DeclareGraphicsExtensions.
%\caption{Simulation results for the network.}
%\label{fig_sim}
%\end{figure}

% Note that the IEEE typically puts floats only at the top, even when this
% results in a large percentage of a column being occupied by floats.


% An example of a double column floating figure using two subfigures.
% (The subfig.sty package must be loaded for this to work.)
% The subfigure \label commands are set within each subfloat command,
% and the \label for the overall figure must come after \caption.
% \hfil is used as a separator to get equal spacing.
% Watch out that the combined width of all the subfigures on a 
% line do not exceed the text width or a line break will occur.
%

%\subfloat[Case II]{\includegraphics[width=2.5in]{box}%
%\label{fig_second_case}}
%\caption{Simulation results for the network.}
%\label{fig_sim}
%\end{figure*}
%
% Note that often IEEE papers with subfigures do not employ subfigure
% captions (using the optional argument to \subfloat[]), but instead will
% reference/describe all of them (a), (b), etc., within the main caption.
% Be aware that for subfig.sty to generate the (a), (b), etc., subfigure
% labels, the optional argument to \subfloat must be present. If a
% subcaption is not desired, just leave its contents blank,
% e.g., \subfloat[].


% An example of a floating table. Note that, for IEEE style tables, the
% \caption command should come BEFORE the table and, given that table
% captions serve much like titles, are usually capitalized except for words
% such as a, an, and, as, at, but, by, for, in, nor, of, on, or, the, to
% and up, which are usually not capitalized unless they are the first or
% last word of the caption. Table text will default to \footnotesize as
% the IEEE normally uses this smaller font for tables.
% The \label must come after \caption as always.
%
%\begin{table}[!t]
%% increase table row spacing, adjust to taste
%\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.3}
% if using array.sty, it might be a good idea to tweak the value of
% \extrarowheight as needed to properly center the text within the cells
%\caption{An Example of a Table}
%\label{table_example}
%\centering
%% Some packages, such as MDW tools, offer better commands for making tables
%% than the plain LaTeX2e tabular which is used here.
%\begin{tabular}{|c||c|}
%\hline
%One & Two\\
%\hline
%Three & Four\\
%\hline
%\end{tabular}
%\end{table}


% Note that the IEEE does not put floats in the very first column
% - or typically anywhere on the first page for that matter. Also,
% in-text middle ("here") positioning is typically not used, but it
% is allowed and encouraged for Computer Society conferences (but
% not Computer Society journals). Most IEEE journals/conferences use
% top floats exclusively. 
% Note that, LaTeX2e, unlike IEEE journals/conferences, places
% footnotes above bottom floats. This can be corrected via the
% \fnbelowfloat command of the stfloats package.
