A composite state is a state that has substates. A substate is a state that belongs to a superstate which is a composite state. A substate represent another possible condition while its superstate is in active. 

The diagram below is a statechart of a fan. The fan has three buttons, a Power Button to turn on/off, a Button 1 to start blowing, and a Button 0 to stop blowing. So far it has only one speed but is planned to have more than one speed.

You are asked to modify the Blowing state into a composite state so i has a Button 1 Active state as its substate. Drag and drop Button 1 Active state into Blowing state compartment and the connect Button 1 Pressed transition from Idle state to Button 1 Active state!
